[Command-Line Apps and TensorFlow](https://planspace.org/20170314-command_line_apps_and_tensorflow/)

I still do not find a good tutorial about `tf.app.flags`

You may also want to test the behavior of a system with a variety of values for certain parameters.
It becomes easier and more repeatable to keep your code the same and run it with different command-line arguments,
rather than editing values in the code directly and re-running.
